        Hi, I'm Hanbo Wang. I started my career as a data analyst and transitioned into data engineering, where I discovered my passion for building scalable data pipelines and optimizing big data workflows.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm proficient in <strong>Rust</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>SQL</strong>, and I'm always curious to explore new programming languages and technologies. My work often involves Spark job optimization, performance tuning, and making data systems more efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
        This site is my space to reflect on lessons learned, share practical notes, and document my journey in the world of data engineering.
