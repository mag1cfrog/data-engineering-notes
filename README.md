## ðŸš€ What You'll Learn

This blog documents practical Spark optimization techniques gained from working with massive datasets in production environments, including:

- **Window Function Performance**: How a simple `ROW_NUMBER()` window function caused 391 GB of disk spilling and 33+ minute execution times
- **Hash vs Sort Aggregation**: Understanding when Spark falls back to expensive sort-based aggregation and how to avoid it
- **Memory Management**: Identifying and fixing disk spilling issues that kill performance
- **Query Profile Analysis**: Reading Databricks query profiles to identify bottlenecks
- **Alternative Approaches**: Using functions like `max_by()` to replace expensive window operations

## ðŸŽ¯ Featured Case Study

**From 33 minutes to 12 minutes**: Learn how replacing a window function with `max_by()` eliminated massive sort operations and reduced execution time by 2.7x on a 2.3 billion row dataset.

### Key Topics Covered:
- Analyzing 391 GB disk spill causes
- Understanding Spark's sort-based vs hash-based aggregation
- Optimizing window functions for large datasets
- Memory-efficient alternatives to `ROW_NUMBER()`
- Production tuning for MLB tracking data processing
